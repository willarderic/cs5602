Here are the instructions for Prelim2.
In the HW directory there is this instruction file and two subdirectories:

	1. DataFiles
	2. EncryptedPrelims
	
In EncruptedPrelims there are 15 files, each containing 10,000 bytes. These are your
encrypted prelims. Each file includes some padding at the end to make all the files
come out the same size. The padding will be obvious once you decrypt the file.
The files are encrypted using the one-time pad that you submitted at the beginning of
this course. To find your copy of Prelim2, you must apply your one-time pad to each
file. Unless people shared their one-time pads, only your version of the exam will
decrypt into an intelligible document. However, you must try to decrypt all the files
unless you happen to find yours before you decrypt all of them using your one-time
pad. I scrambled the order of the files so that the numbers 00..14 do correspond to
the alphabetical order of your names. You will get 15 points for decrypting your version
of Prelim2 without assistance from me. If you need assistance to decrypt, you will get 
fewer points. The exact amount depends on how much help you need.

Once you decrypt your copy of Prelim2, you will find two kinds of questions:

	1. Questions that are self-contained and do not need any further information.
	2. Questions that refer to a file with a name something like FileYYY.bin or FileYYY.txt.
	
You should get to work on questions of Type 1, e.g., those questions that do not require any
further information. I do not have the files ready for the questions of Type 2 yet. By the time 
you work through all the questions of Type 1, I should have the files of Type 2 ready for you.
I will send an email notification when the files of Type 2 are ready.

If you have any questions or problems, please let me know by email: markov@mst.edu.
